          If you're reading this it's probably because you've seen the domain in my email and decided to be nosey. That's cool, that's exactly what I would do if I was thinking of hiring someone. I'm a (mostly) front end web developer who likes to use JavaScript wherever possible. I put this together using a <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gatsby.js</a> starter and <a href="https://vercel.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vercel</a>.
        </p>
        <p>For the last few years I've mostly been working for a fantastic Manchester web development agency called <a href="https://www.unbrandedmanchester.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unbranded</a> based in MediaCity, here's <a href="https://www.unbrandedmanchester.com/research-projects/layout-composer/" rel="noopener noreferrer">an article I wrote</a> for their website.</p>

        <p>I mostly just use this domain for email, so it's pretty likely if you check back in a week or two that this will be completely different, or broken, or used for some other experiment. Whilst you're here though, you might as well be extra nosey and see <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=sourcewebdev.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">what score this page gets in Google Pagespeed</a>.</p>
